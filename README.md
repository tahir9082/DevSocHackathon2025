## üèπ: 1. Motivation 

Picking courses at UNSW can sometimes be challenging, especially as a first year student without a general idea of what they would like to pursue as a career.

Perhaps you're a third year student regretting the decision to do Computer Science entirely, and want to switch to something else but you don't know what. 

Even though UNSW provides a course handbook, traversing something that information heavy can be overwhelming for most students.

What do you search for? How can you filter based on core topics? How can you choose the subjects based on your interests?

The point is, as useful as the UNSW handbook might be, it lacks the personalised experience that we provide with our solution.

This is how our project, Reco, came to be. A course planner app that suggests courses based on a pre-determined criteria that you can choose yourself.
